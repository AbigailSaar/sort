sort.h 
======
Overview
--------

'Sort.h' is collection of many sorting algorithms in C Language. The overhead of the using SLR is not needed. It is an optmizited implementation of sorting algorithms.

You also do not need to link to the library, whole program is contained in the header files. 

You can do the following sorting using the code:

* Shellsort - combination of insertion and bubble sort.
* Heapsort  - An improved selection sort algorithm

* Quicksort - Based on improving the spee of average case.
* Merge sort - Divide and conquer algorithm explaination can be found on this <a href="http://99dollardesigners.com/">page</a>.
* In-place merge sort (*not* stable)
* Selection sort - Based on selection of elements
* Other sorting algorithms
